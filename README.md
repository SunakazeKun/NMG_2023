# Neo Mario Galaxy: *Final Update* Source Code

This repository contains the complete source code for my [Neo Mario Galaxy](https://aurumsmods.com/nmg/) project, the 2023 update branch in particular. Please note that this repository does not include any of the mod's assets, as these were created and edited directly in binary formats.

Originally, this code was not intended for the public as the features were exclusively created for Neo Mario Galaxy. However, given that nearly two years have passed since the final update, I have decided to make the source code publicly available for preservation purposes. **If you wish to use my custom features, please make sure to credit me (Aurum) appropriately. That's all I'm asking for.**

# Important notes
- No support will be provided for using or integrating this code.
- The codebase has not been updated since the mod's final release and is unlikely to receive any further updates.
- It was developed using an older version of Syati. Porting it to newer versions may be difficult due to changes in header files.
- Compatibility with the Taiwanese and Korean versions of SMG2 isn't guaranteed. I never bothered checking out why those versions crashed.
